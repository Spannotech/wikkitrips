         to study or work where English is used as a language of communication. It uses a nine-band scale to clearly 
         identify levels of proficiency, from non-user (band score 1) through to expert (band score 9). IELTS is the
          most popular English language test in the world and the only English language test accepted for immigration
           purposes by all countries that require one.</p>
